## 💡 What is this?

I created a simple, Apple-style bio page that includes all my important links in one place:

- GitHub
- LinkedIn
- YouTube
- Instagram
- TikTok
- My website
- Facebook

## 🌍 Live site:
👉 [https://peterfromslovakia.github.io/quickbiolinks/](https://peterfromslovakia.github.io/quickbiolinks/)

## 👨‍💻 Why?

This page serves as my **personal link hub** – a place to quickly share all important social and web links through one clean and elegant page.  
Perfect for sharing via social media, email signatures, or QR codes.
